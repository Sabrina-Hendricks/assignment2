        "2. The \"tidy data standard\" is intended to make initial exploration and analysis of a dataset smoother and easier, while also allowing other data analysis tools to work well together.\n",
        "3. The first sentence means that tidy datasets have a stucture they all follow whereas messy sets do not...that's why they're messy. The second sentence discusses how when looking at a specific dataset, you can pick out what are supposed to be observations and variables. However, these terms can be subjective because it's hard to define them when not focusing on a specific example of a dataset.\n",
        "4. Values are numbers, if quantitative, and strings, if qualitative. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute across units. Observations contain all values measured on the same unit across attributes.\n",
        "5. \"Tidy Data\" is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure.\n",
        "6. The 5 most common problems with messy datasets are:\n",
        "  - Column headers are values, not variable names.\n",
        "  - Multiple variables are stored in one column.\n",
        "  - Variables are stored in both rows and columns.\n",
        "  - Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.\n",
        "  - A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
        "- The data in Table 4 are messy because the variables\n",
        "form both the rows and columns, and the column headers are values, not variable names. \"Melting\" a dataset is turning its columns into rows.\n",
        "7. Table 11 is messy because there is a column for every possible day in the month. Table 12 (a) is \"molten\" because each row now represents the meteorological measurements for a single day. Table 12 (b) is tidy because the element column was fixed from (a) to contain values and not names of variables. Now there are two measured\n",

        "8. The \"chicken and the egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data is that tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, so then tidy tools with data cleaning won't improve workflow. He hopes that in the future, he hopes to further understand the cognitve aspect of data wrangling and to continue building useful tools. Specifically, he hopes more work is done with multidimensional arrays, optimizing memory and efficiency, and generally developing other frameworks to make all of data wrangling easier."
