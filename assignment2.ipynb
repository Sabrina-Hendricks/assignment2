        "2. The \"tidy data standard\" is intended to make initial exploration and analysis of a dataset smoother and easier, while also allowing other data analysis tools to work well together.\n",
        "3. The first sentence means that tidy datasets have a stucture they all follow whereas messy sets do not...that's why they're messy. The second sentence discusses how when looking at a specific dataset, you can pick out what are supposed to be observations and variables. However, these terms can be subjective because it's hard to define them when not focusing on a specific example of a dataset.\n",
        "4. Values are numbers, if quantitative, and strings, if qualitative. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute across units. Observations contain all values measured on the same unit across attributes.\n",
        "5. \"Tidy Data\" is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure.\n",
        "6. The 5 most common problems with messy datasets are:\n",
        "  - Column headers are values, not variable names.\n",
        "  - Multiple variables are stored in one column.\n",
        "  - Variables are stored in both rows and columns.\n",

Table 12 (a) is \"molten\" because each row now represents the meteorological measurements for a single day. Table 12 (b) is tidy because the element column was fixed from (a) to contain values and not names of variables. Now there are two measured variables, minimum (tmin) and maximum (tmax) temperature.\n",

        "8. The \"chicken and the egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data is that tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, so then tidy tools with data cleaning won't improve workflow. He hopes that in the future, he hopes to further understand the cognitve aspect of data wrangling and to continue building useful tools. Specifically, he hopes more work is done with multidimensional arrays, optimizing memory and efficiency, and generally developing other frameworks to make all of data wrangling easier."

        "1. The US Census has 3 main ways of collecting data: mail canvass, Internet collection, and central collection from state sources which vary by state. From these sources, a questionnaire allows for self-identification of five minimum categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) or “Other.”\n",
        "- Sources: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/gov-finances/technical-documentation/methodology/how-the-data-are-collected.html, https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/note/US/RHI625222\n",
        "2. We gather these data to collect information about how various circumstances vary depending on race. For example, having this variable is pertinent for the government in deciding and analyzing concepts like resource allocation, economic trends, social justice, and overall accountability of policies. These data can play a role in politics and society by shining a light on the disparities in resources and facts depending on race. Recognizing and identifying where things are unequal is the first step in knowing where and how to fix these issues. Data quality matters to be able to correctly and confidently identify these disparities/differences across races. Without this assurance, policy makers could not be confident in their proposed changes.\n",
        "3. The Census did a good job of using state and local governments to send out questionnaires and collect any missing data. Dividing the outreach in this way ensures that the process is more organized, as each individual sector is responsible for collecting its responses. The federal government sending out mass questionnaires would probably not produce as accurate and comprehensive results. I believe that it was missing a way to gather data on individuals who may not have access to technology and have not officially documented their education/finances. This group could apply to those who are homeless or undocumented immigrants. To better reflect the diversity of the population, it could be a good idea for future large scale surveys to have more physical employees conduct information. For example, visiting communities in which many homeless people reside. They could expand on their good process of dividing up this data collection into state and local governments to send employees into underserved areas of that region. In addition, asking individuals to fit themselves into a socially-constructed idea of race can be restricting. People's self-identification of culture can vary widely. For example, someone who identifies as “American Indian” may not identify as “Alaska native,” though the option is “American Indian or Alaska native.” This is constraining—it could be a good idea to separate any categories that use “or” into two separate categories. It is good that they are currently allowing an “Other” option, though in the future, it is important that they continue to update their questionnaire based on how society is evolving in its conception of race. It is also good that they allow individuals to select multiple races to convey being mixed race.\n",
        "4. The Census collected the data on sex and gender in a similar method as race with the general questionnaires, etc. However, the questions asked were different to collect this specific data. The questions asked for gender identity were “What sex were you assigned at birth, on your original birth certificate?” with options “Male, Female” and “Do you currently describe yourself as male, female, or transgender?” with options “Male, Female, Transgender, None.” I think it is good that they are separating the questions about asking birth-assigned gender versus self-identification since they might be different classifications. However, the question asking about how an individual currently describes themselves is problematic because not everyone fits into the three categories offered. Having the fourth option be “None” is not sufficient for including a group of individuals who say, for example, don’t identify with any gender. It could be better to have that option be “Other” instead. As with the Race variable, it is important to continue to update the questions as the society evolves its conception of sex and gender.\n",
        "- Source: https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity.html\n",
        "5. When cleaning data, we are trying to make our data as easy to analyze as possible. These variables–sex, gender, sexual identity, and race–could have vastly different responses when leaving it open-ended. This could make it hard to graph and analyze data in which we cannot definitely know the information for a categorical variable. In addition, especially as time goes on, these ideas may change and our ways of shifting these data may be out-dated and need readjustment. Biases towards these social conceptions is also a huge concern. It is challenging when there are missing values because assigning someone a value of “nan” is equivalent to saying they have no race/gender/sex which is inaccurate. This brings up ethical concerns for deciding how to fit a human being into a category that we have created for them. People might adopt a bad practice of dropping individuals from their dataset that don’t perfectly fit a category to make it easier to manipulate and analyze. This is problematic because they are then losing data points. Alternatively, people might use good practices such as mitigating their biases while heavily documententing why they make their data cleaning choices. Having replicable results when cleaning these types of data is pertinent to ensuring it is unbiased—others can cross-validate your work and ensure one did not make socially-incorrect wrangling decisions.\n",
        "6. An algorithm designed to impute protected characteristics is at risk of making biases present in the training data much more exaggerated. This can lead to reinforcing stereotypes, and unfair treatment based on these characteristics. It is generally concerning to have algorithms look for patterns and similarities across these variables as it could easily lead to inaccurate results for an individual. Humans are much more complex than just their race, gender, sex, and sexuality. In addition, replicating this algorithm could raise privacy concerns for individuals in the training data.\n"
